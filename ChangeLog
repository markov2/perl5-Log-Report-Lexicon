==== version history of Log::Report::Lexicon

Unless noted otherwise, these changes where initiated and applied by
Mark Overmeer.

bugs:
	- with multiple domains extracted at once, remove references which
	  appear in one PO but the file moved to other domain, not scanned
	  in the same xgettext-perl run.
	- manual-page for xgettext-perl is missing
	- xgettext-perl does not yet support __*p* introduced by Log::Report
	  version 1.22.  It should probably accept variables as $msgctxt
	  argument, to make code maintainable.

wishlist:
	- let xgettext-perl produce mo files as well.
